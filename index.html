              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                This final project was created by Maria Boza (mib57) & Ashley Heckman (agh93) for Cornell’s ECE 
                5725 Spring 2023 class. We implemented a planter that has many capabilities. The brains of our 
                project is the Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi), which has been used all semester to work on our labs. We 
                used four sensor readings: soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and light. These were received 
                with a plant monitor and photoresistor sensor. We also implemented a camera to send a live feed of 
                the plant to a website. We used python to code all of the sensor readings, the camera, and the GUI 
                (which was displayed on the piTFT). This project is geared towards new plant owners who do not know
                 much about plants and would like help. It is also geared towards people who cannot water their own 
                 plants.</p>

              <h2>Design</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                We decided to make a product that will help plant growers have the ability to leave their plants 
                unattended but still have them get watered. It also supports new plant growers in understanding how 
                to water their new plants through the recommended watering cycles. Our system utilizes a water 
                reservoir and a planter, along with the RPi, sensors, and water pump. The water reservoir is 
                connected to one side of the water pump, and tubing leading to the planter is connected to the 
                other side of the water pump. We attached tubing around the edge of the planter, poking holes 
                facing towards the plant in order to water it.<br><br>
                We decided to create three watering modes: manual, moisture, and interval. Manual mode requires 
                that the user presses start and stop to turn the water on and off. Moisture mode will automatically 
                water the plant when the soil moisture drops below a set value. Interval mode will automatically 
                water the plant at the specified interval.<br><br>
                The RPi is the brains of our embedded system, and it controls the watering of the plant, reads 
                the sensor values, and displays/controls the GUI. We used moisture, humidity, temperature, and 
                light because that is the basis of what a plant needs to survive. We created a GUI that shows the 
                user current sensor readings, the last time the plant was watered, and the current watering schedule. 
                It also allows the user to change the watering schedule. We created another program that can run at 
                the same time as this that displays a live feed of the plant. As we started the project, we planted 
                the seeds in a 3D-printed planter. This was the best way to do it because it allowed us to create a 
                pot that precisely fits our sensors, the tubing, and our water pump. All components are described in 
                more detail below.<br><br>
                <b>Plant Monitor</b><br>
                We used the Monk Makes plant monitor to measure temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The sensor 
                communicates with the RPi through a serial UART connection. It has five pins: GND, 3V, TX_OUT, RX_IN, 
                and an analog pin to be used for just reading soil moisture. Since we wanted all of the measurements 
                from this sensor, we ignored the analog pin. We hooked GND up to our common ground from the RPi, 3V 
                up to 3.3V from the RPi, TX_OUT up to RX on the RPi, and RX_IN up to TX on the RPi. A diagram of these 
                connections is shown below in <i>Drawing 2</i>. To program this sensor, we simply went to the github page 
                listed on the instruction manual and copied over their functions for reading the different values. 
                When we wanted to read the values, we called the functions.<br><br>
                <b>Light Sensor</b><br>
                The sunlight sensor consists of a photoresistor and a capacitor. We connected one side of the 
                photoresistor to 3.3V and the other side to the positive end of the capacitor. The negative end 
                of the capacitor was connected to ground. We then connected GPIO 16 to the junction of the 
                photoresistor and capacitor. We measured the amount of light by setting the GPIO as an output and 
                outputting low, then immediately setting it as an input and counting how long it took for the 
                signal to switch from low to high. The faster the signal switched, the more light in the area. 
                We wanted a higher number to correspond to more light, so we found the maximum time that it took 
                for the signal to switch, then subtracted the measured time from that value, and displayed that. 
                A schematic of this circuit is shown in <i>Drawing 3</i>.<br><br>
                <b>Water Pump</b><br>
                We connected one end of our water pump to our water reservoir and the other to the tubing attached 
                to the border of our planter. The pump was controlled with a motor driver and a PWM signal. Through 
                trial and error, we found a frequency and duty cycle that watered the plant well. The water pump has 
                two inputs: power and ground. We connected power to an output on the motor controller, and ground to 
                our common ground. The water pump is the only external electronic that requires a power supply to work 
                and function as needed. It runs at 12V, and the Rpi cannot supply that much voltage. A drawing of the 
                water pump circuit is shown in <i>Drawing 4</i>.<br><br>
                <b>Camera</b><br>
                We used a RPi Camera to display a livestream of our plant. To do this, we simply copied the web 
                streaming code from the PiCamera documentation. We edited the HTML website, but the underlying 
                code is all the same. To get this to work, we had to open the RPi configuration settings and turn 
                on camera support. The Rpi itself hosted this website, located at 'RPi IP Address':8000/index.html. 
                  To find the IP address, we typed ‘ifconfig -a’ into the command line. The website is only live 
                  while we’re running our program, so we’ve included a picture of our website.

              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                <br><b>GUI</b><br>
                We used PyGame to create the GUI. The GUI has 11 different screens that it can display. The first 
                screen is the homescreen, which displays the current sensor readings, the time the plant was last 
                watered, and the current watering schedule. If the system is in manual watering mode, this screen 
                will allow the user to start and stop the water. The user can also edit the schedule from this 
                screen.<br><br>
                If the user decides to edit the schedule, the GUI transitions to screen 1. This screen displays 
                all three watering modes, and gives a short description of each mode. If the user selects a mode, 
                it will display in blue instead of white, indicating that it’s been selected. Once the user selects 
                a mode and clicks next, the GUI transitions to the next screen. If the user selected manual or 
                interval mode, this is screen 2. If the user selected moisture mode, this is screen 3.<br><br>
                The second screen repeats the short description of the mode selected, then prompts the user to input 
                their desired value (if applicable), then set the schedule. If the user selected manual mode, there is 
                nothing to input. If the user selected moisture mode, they can input moisture levels from 1% to 100%. 
                If the user selected interval mode, they can input a wide range of intervals ranging from seconds to 
                days. If the user tries to input an invalid interval (for example, 10 seconds every 5 seconds), the 
                GUI doesn’t allow the user to proceed to the next screen. Once the user selects set, the GUI returns 
                to the homescreen.<br><br>
                The third screen is part of the moisture sensing mode, and prompts the user to enter their plant type. 
                There are four categories: flowers, fruits, trees/shrubs, and manual moisture value. If the user 
                selects ‘my own value,’ the GUI will transition to screen 2. Otherwise, if the user selects a plant 
                type, the GUI will transition to screen 4 for flowers, 6 for fruits, and 7 for trees. Screens 4 and 
                5 display the list of flowers. Screen 6 displays the list of fruits. Screens 7, 8, and 9 display the 
                list of trees/shrubs. The last screen for all plant types also has an ‘other’ option, which averages 
                the recommended moisture level for all plants in that category, then recommends that value. If the 
                user selects a specific plant from the list then clicks next, the GUI transitions to screen 10. If 
                the user selects other, the GUI advances to screen 11.<br><br>
                Screen 10 displays the moisture mode, the name of the plant selected, and the recommended soil 
                moisture value for that plant. From this screen, the user can either click set (returning to the 
                homescreen and updating the schedule), edit (going to screen 2 but starting with the recommended 
                value instead of the previous value), back, or cancel. Screen 11 displays the moisture mode, plant 
                type selected, and the recommended value for that plant type. The user has the same options as 
                screen 10 from this screen.<br><br>
                The GUI is controlled by a big while code_run loop. We store a global variable keeping track of the 
                screens, and we call the function that displays the corresponding screen in each iteration. We check 
                for button presses in every iteration of this loop. If we’re on the homescreen, the GUI also reads in 
                new sensor values in every iteration.  If the GUI is on the homescreen and moisture mode is selected, 
                it checks if the plant is currently being watered. If it is being watered and the soil moisture is at 
                or equal to the selected value, it turns the water off. If it’s not being watered and the soil 
                moisture is below the selected value, it turns the water on. We do this instead of a while measured 
                moisture < desired moisture loop because it allows us to still respond to button presses. If we’re 
                in interval mode and on the homescreen, the GUI will check if the plant is currently being watered. 
                If it is, it checks if the current time is greater than or equal to the watering start time plus how 
                long the water needs to run, and turns the water off if this is true. If it isn’t being watered, the 
                GUI will check if the current time is greater than or equal to the time the water ended plus the time 
                between waterings, and if this is true, it will start the water.<br><br>
                We decided to only allow the plant to be watered when the GUI is on the homescreen. We felt that if 
                the user is changing the schedule, they wouldn’t want the plant to be watered during that time, so we 
                turn the water off when the user selects edit schedule. The GUI calculates how long to water in 
                internal mode by converting all times to seconds. From there, knowing that the user inputted 
                ‘a units0 every b units1,’ we can calculate how long to wait between waterings. The water time is 
                simply a (in seconds), and the time between is b - a (also in seconds). Almost every screen has a 
                back or cancel button. A picture of the GUI homescreen is shown below.

                Diagram 1 shows a high level overview of all of the hardware components of our project. The 
                diagram comprises the RPi/piTFT, which are placed one on top of the other and connected to the 
                main breadboard with the Pi Cobbler (labeled extender). This connector allows other peripherals 
                to link to pins that the piTFT does not use. A camera is connected to the RPi directly through a 
                camera port on the device. A photoresistor is connected to a capacitor and a GPIO pin on the RPi. 
                The motor driver is connected to a PWM pin on the RPi; the water pump’s VCC and ground connectors, 
                and an external power supply of 12V. One end of the water pump is connected to the reservoir (input) 
                and the other to the plant (output). The last thing is the plant monitor sensor. This sensor is 
                connected to the positive(+) and negative/ground (-) sides of the breadboard, and RX and TX pins 
                on the RPi. Diagrams 2, 3, and 4 give a more in-depth view of the individual component hookups.<br>

              <h2>Testing</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                Testing was done in sections. We started by creating the 3D-printed pot; we went through about 
                four different iterations of the flower pot. This was because we wanted to make sure that 
                everything fit perfectly together. The first thing that was created was the homescreen of the 
                GUI. From there, we tested the water pump alongside the sensors and the camera. Once all parts 
                worked, we integrated them and made our final demo. The following is our testing of each of the 
                significant components of our project.<br><br>
                <b>Plant Monitor</b><br>
                We worked with two different moisture sensors throughout this project. The first sensor worked, 
                but could only determine if the moisture level exceeded a certain threshold, which could be 
                changed by spinning a screw on the sensor. Because of this, we decided to try a new sensor to 
                measure the moisture level, and we ordered the plant monitor sensor.<br><br>
                The plant monitor can sense soil moisture, humidity, and temperature. This sensor was better to 
                use because it gave us real values and not just high/low. It also didn’t take up any GPIO pins, 
                as all communication with the RPi was through a serial UART connection. This sensor also had a 
                lot more documentation than our original sensor, making it much easier to work with.<br><br>
                We tested this component by holding the top part (which measures temperature and humidity), and 
                watching both values increase. When we released the sensor, the values both returned to around 
                where they were before. We repeated this with the bottom part (the prong that gets inserted into 
                the soil), and watched as the moisture level rose when we held it and fell when we released it.<br><br>
                <b>Light Sensor</b><br>
                We also worked with two different light sensors. The first sensor was a board with a photoresistor, 
                resistor, and three pins: VCC, ground, and signal. We couldn’t find any documentation for this 
                sensor, and when we tried to code it and hook it up, it only read 0. We decided to change to a 
                regular photoresistor and capacitor instead. We tested this by holding our hand over the 
                photoresistor and watching the measured light level drop, then holding a flashlight up to the 
                photoresistor and watching the measured light level rise. While testing this sensor, we noticed 
                that the values were never exactly the same, so we decided to round our light value to the nearest 
                50. The value still changes some, but it is much more stable with this modification.<br><br>
                <b>Water Pump</b><br>
                We obtained two pumps before starting this project. The first pump seemed much more complex, 
                especially since we couldn’t find any documentation for it. The second pump had more 
                documentation and seemed simpler, so we decided to use that pump. This pump is very similar 
                to a motor. Given this, we used a motor driver with a PWM signal to control the pump. To test 
                that the pump worked, we hooked the power and ground wires directly to our power supply, and 
                watched the water pump. We found that the pump only worked when placed in a specific orientation, 
                and mode note of this for future reference.<br><br>
                One interesting thing we found when implementing the water pump control was that GPIO 6 had to be 
                specified as an output and set to low for the pump to work. We found this surprising, as we had 
                power hooked up to GPIO 5 and ground hooked up to our common ground. We didn’t have anything 
                connected to AOUT2, so we were surprised that the AIN2 input mattered.<br><br>
                <b>Camera</b><br>
                We tested that the camera worked by using the preview command. We learned that the module could 
                do some cool things to the image, such as putting a ‘filter’ on it or adding text to what the 
                camera sees. In the end, we didn’t use these features, but we enjoyed playing with them during 
                development. We tested the camera by running the live stream code and observing the website. We 
                quickly found that the website was indeed displaying what the camera saw, so we concluded that 
                the camera was working.<br><br>
                <b>GUI</b><br>
                We tested the GUI by observing what happens when buttons are pressed. For buttons that don’t 
                switch screens (such as turning the water on or off), we began testing by printing out a statement 
                acknowledging that a certain button had been pressed. As we tested and integrated the other sensors,
                 we moved away from testing with print statements and towards observing what happens with the 
                 system. We tried to (and think we succeeded with) pressing all buttons on all screens to test the 
                 GUI, and consequently, the system as a whole.

              <h2>Result</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">
                Our project is fully functional and works as intended. Our user interface displays all of the 
                information that the user needs: soil moisture, humidity, air temperature, amount of light, the 
                last time the plant was watered, and the current watering cycle. It also gives the user a lot of 
                flexibility in how they want to water their plants. The soil moisture level increases as the plant 
                is watered (as expected), and the temperature and humidity increase if we hold those sensors 
                (also as expected). The light decreases if we put our hand over the sensor, and increases if we 
                hold a flashlight up to it. Our camera feature is also fully operational; the user can see a live 
                feed of their plant as long as they’re on the same network as the RPi.<br><br>
                The user can choose from three watering schedules: manual, moisture, and interval. The manual 
                option allows the user to turn the water pump on and off. The moisture mode will automatically 
                water the plant when the soil moisture drops below the set level. The user can input their own value 
                for this, or they can use our recommended values. The user selects a recommended value by picking 
                their plant type: flower, fruit, or tree/shrub. If their plant is in the list, they can simply select 
                their plant. Otherwise, they can select other and get a recommended value for their plant type as a 
                whole. The interval option allows for a timed approach to watering the plant. For example, the user 
                can set the system to water for 10 seconds every 3 days.<br><br>
                All in all, we created a system for both beginners and for people who can’t water their own plants. 
                In the end, everything performed as planned and we met all goals outlined in the project objectives. 
                Luckily, we didn’t run into anything that we couldn’t get working.<br><br>
                <b>Future Work</b><br>
                Although our time in class has ended, our work on this project has not. In the future, we plan on 
                putting our system in a display case. This will require some modification, as we cannot have water 
                or motors in our display. If we had more time in this class, we would have liked to add more features 
                to our system.<br><br>
                One idea was to take pictures of our plant at a set interval, then display a time lapse on our 
                website. It would be nice if the camera was in the same position relative to the plant for all 
                pictures, so we’d also like to build a stand for the camera. Another idea was to allow the user to 
                edit the watering schedule through the website. We also would have liked to store previous sensor 
                measurements and display them in graphs on the website. Our last idea was to have our system search 
                the internet for recommended moisture values or watering intervals, and use that to recommend values 
                to the user, rather than storing specific plants in an array.
