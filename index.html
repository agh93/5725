              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">This final project was created by Maria Boza (mib57) & Ashley Heckman (agh93) for Cornellâ€™s ECE 5725 Spring 2023 class. The project has been our implementation of a planter that has more capabilities. We started with the central part of the project, which is the Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi) that has been used all semester to work on our labs. We used four sensor readings: moister, humidity, temperature, and light. These were received with a plant monitor and photoresistor sensor. Also implemented was a camera to send a live feed to a website. Python was used to code all the sensor readings, camera, and what is displayed on the piTFT. This project is geared towards new plant owners who do not know much about plants and would like help. Another way our product can be used is to monitor plants when humans cannot water them.</p>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Design</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">For the design of this project, we decided to make a product that will help plant growers have the ability to leave their plants unattended and have them get watered. It also supports new plant growers in understanding how to water their new plants and set the recommended watering cycles. The product's design started with the RPi, which we used to create an embedded system. As we started the project, we planted the seeds in a 3D-printed planter. This was the best way to do it because it meant that we could create one that fits precisely with our pump and fits the tubing. As for the sensors, we used moister, humidity, temperature, and light. We decided that these were the best for our implementation because it was the basis of what a plant needs to survive. Another huge part of our project was our graphical user interface (GUI) on the piTFT. This was used for the user to implement what they wanted and can edit the settings. We also implemented a camera feature that will display a live feed of the plant on a website hosted with the Rpi.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>Sensors & Pump:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The first sensor we used was the plant monitor sensor. This sensor contained the soil's moisture level, humidity, and air temperature. It uses serial communication to communicate with the Rpi. It has five pins, ground, VCC, TX, RX, and analog signal. We used all of them except for the analog signal because the Rpi does not have an analog reader meaning that we were to use RX and TX. As per the photoresistor, this was used with a capacitor. It was programmed with a GPIO pin which was changed from high to low, and that is how we calculated the values. These values were then displayed on the PiTFT. The pump was used with a motor driver very similar to that of the lab we did in the lab. The water pump used a PWM signal to control how much water to pump and when to pump. The water pump is also the only external electronic with a power supply to work and function as needed. It runs at 12V, and the Rpi can not handle that much voltage.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>GUI:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Add more about GUI.........</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>Camera:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">We implemented the camera using the raspberry pi libraries. It was simple to use and code. After the camera displayed the correct video, we created a live feed on a website. The Rpi itself hosted this website and could show the live feed that the camera was capturing of the plant.</p>

      <div style="text-align:center;">
              <h2>Testing</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Testing was done in sections. We started by creating the 3D-printed pot; we went through about four different iterations of the flower pot. This was because we wanted to make sure that everything fit perfectly together. The first thing that was created was the first screen of the GUI. This was tested, though, ensuring the display was working correctly. From there, we tested the water pump alongside the sensors and the camera. After all the separate parts worked, we integrated them and made our final demo. The following is our testing of each of the significant components of our project.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>Sensors:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The first sensor that was worked on was the moisture sensor. This sensor was working but could only be used to determine whether it was over a certain amount. This was caused because there was no analog reader on board the Rpi. After this, we decided to scratch this sensor and get a new one with all three we needed. It was changed into a plant monitor. The plant monitor has moisture of soil, humidity, and temperature sensors. This sensor was better to use because it would give us values of the sensors and not just a digital value. The plant monitor uses serial communication using TX and RX. Another good thing about the plant monitor was that there was much documentation compared to the other sensor making it a lot easier to work with. In addition to our final project was a photoresistor to measure light. The first sensor we used was a board with a photoresistor with three pins: VCC, ground, and single. Once we coded and tested it, we noticed that the sensor only read 00. We caught the problem and changed it to a regular photoresistor and capacitor. The code was written to gather the amount of light as the pin goes from high to low and calculate that value to display on the piTFT.</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>Pump:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">The first pump we worked with was much more complex than the one we used in the final demonstration. This was because it took more work to understand, and a minimal amount of documentation was found. The newer pump was easier to implement because of past labs that we did in the lab. This pump was used very similarly to a motor. Given this, we used a motor driver to use a PWM signal to control the pump. Testing this, we used the created GUI to turn the motor on and off. One thing that we learned was that the pump had to be run with water, and once it ran with water, it had to be placed at a specific angle to get as much power as possible. Unfortunately, this caused a bit of a mess, especially dealing with everything we had to hold, like the reservoir and output. </p>     
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>GUI:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">Add more about GUI.........</p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;"><b>Camera:</b></p>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">To test the camera, we used the preview command to be able to make sure it worked. We learned that the module could do some cool things to the image, for example, put a â€˜filterâ€™ on it or add text to what the camera sees. Other abilities we did not use were the capture picture or video feature. Since we just wanted to display a live feed, we got to work on a website hosted by the raspberry pi we used.</p>

              <h2>Result</h2>
              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">As a result of our project, we demonstrated the full functionality of our product, which worked as we intended. We showed all the features we implemented, starting with the GUI. The user interface displayed the soil's moister level, humidity, air temperature, amount of sunlight, the last time the plant was watered, and different watering cycles. We showed how the levels changed from low (before the plant was watered) to high (after the plant was watered). The user could choose from three different watering cycles, manual, interval, and plant choice. The manual option allowed the user to turn on and off the watering system. The interval choice allowed watering the plant depending on the interval set. For example, it can water for five seconds every day. The last watering option was plant choice. This gave the user the ability to select the specific type of plant that was planted and the recommended level of moisture. There were three plant groups, flowers, fruit, and trees/shrubs. We also demonstrated how the camera worked and the live feed of the plant on the website. All in all, we worked together to create an automatic watering system for beginners with the ability to water different plants. To test the camera, we used the preview command to be able to make sure it worked. We learned that the module could do some cool things to the image, for example, put a 'filter' on it or add text to what the camera sees. Other abilities we should have used were the capture picture or video feature. Since we just wanted to display a live feed, we got to work on a website hosted by the raspberry pi we used.</p>

              <h2>Future Work</h2>

              <p style="text-align: left;padding: 0px 30px;">As our time in class has ended, our project sure has not. In the future, we plan on putting our demo on display. It will be with a small amount of modification since we can not be running water pumps in the case of a fire. As for the extension of this project, we want to create a stand for the camera so that the live feed can be seen instead of holding it up. As well as have a times lap of the plant growing, you can see how the plant grows every day. This can be done by fast-forwarding a video that the camera takes or using multiple captured pictures to stitch together and see it from that perspective. Another addition is to be able to control it from the website. For example, we are allowing the user to change the water cycle without being near the plant. We also want to include the feature of searching the web for the levels of a specific plant.</p>
